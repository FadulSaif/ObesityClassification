# JuiceManagementStore
This is a Juice management store system that was created using various data structures like linked list, queue and hash tree. 
The system of the juice management store was designed to be efficient and smooth in operation by using fundamental data structures. In managing customer orders, a queue is used to ensure that there is fairness and smooth processing, especially when peak times occur. A hash table is used to handle the list of cashiers where quick access and updating can be performed by assigning each cashier a username. Moreover, the inventory of ingredients and supplies has been maintained through a linked list for dynamic addition or removal. The system offers organized operations, adaptability, and generally improved performance with such data structures.
